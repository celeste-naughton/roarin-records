# Project 3: Design Journey

**For each milestone, complete only the sections that are labeled with that milestone.** Refine all sections before the final submission.

You are graded on your design process. If you later need to update your plan, **do not delete the original plan, rather leave it in place and append your new plan _below_ the original.** Then explain why you are changing your plan. Any time you update your plan, you're documenting your design process!

**Replace ALL _TODOs_ with your work.** (There should be no TODOs in the final submission.)

Be clear and concise in your writing. Bullets points are encouraged.

**Everything, including images, must be visible in _Markdown: Open Preview_.** If it's not visible in the Markdown preview, then we can't grade it. We also can't give you partial credit either. **Please make sure your design journey should is easy to read for the grader;** in Markdown preview the question _and_ answer should have a blank line between them.


## Design Plan (Milestone 1)

**Make the case for your decisions using concepts from class, as well as other design principles, theories, examples, and cases from outside of class (includes the design prerequisite for this course).**

You can use bullet points and lists, or full paragraphs, or a combo, whichever is appropriate. The writing should be solid draft quality.


### Catalog (Milestone 1)
> What will your catalog website be about? (1 sentence)

Catalog Brainstorm Ideas

- Trading cards: Pokemon
- Ice skates/skating attire
- Shopping/clothing website
- Vintage record website
- R&B Catalog
  - Vinyl record Shop
- Crochet Clothing store catalog
- Childhood video games
- Mario Cart Top Characters/Cars
- Magazine Catalog
  - Images that lead to each story

- Blog Catalog
  - Posts that are posted that link to the story associated with it


**Catalog Topic**: Online Vinyl Record Shop


### _Consumer_ Audience (Milestone 1)
> Briefly explain your site's _consumer_ audience. Your audience should be specific, but not arbitrarily specific. (1 sentence)
> Justify why this audience is a **cohesive** group. (1-2 sentences)
>


Site audience: People interested in Vinyl records for decor, to listen to and to gift to people who collect Vinyl Records

Why is this a _cohesive_ audience?

This is a cohesive audience because it's not too broad where it includes everyone on the web, but narrows down a specific set of people who are interested in the niche of vinyl records. People coming to this website are able to look for a specific type of record to their liking without being too narrow.


### _Consumer_ Audience Goals (Milestone 1)
> Document your _consumer_ audience's goals for using this catalog website.
> List each goal below. There is no specific number of goals required for this, but you need enough to do the job (Hint: It's more than 1. But probably not more than 3.)
> **Hint:** Users will be able to view all entries in the catalog and insert new entries into the catalog. The audience's goals should probably relate to these activities.

Goal 1: Easily search/look for a record that fits your personal music tatst

- **Design Ideas and Choices** _How will you meet those goals in your design?_
  - Have a search function within the catalog and filters based on genre, artists, year, awards etc.
  - Have images/icons that show how things are sorted (up vs. down arrows)
- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes._
  - Having the ability to search and filter allows for people to narrow down a large amount of information into something that's easier to digest

Goal 2: Use an intuitive and aesthetically pleasing user interface

- **Design Ideas and Choices** _How will you meet those goals in your design?_
  - Use consistent design patterns throughout my website, with backgrounds that enhance the product and easy to read text and headings.
- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes._
  - It's important for users to like the site that they're on so they spend more time interacting with your website and enjoy the time they're spending finding what they want.

Goal 3:  Have a customizable experience on the website

- Design ideas
  - Having a sign in option and letting people save their favorite records or add to a shopping cart to fulfill an order.
- Rationale
  - Customization is really important in helping users find what they're looking for, but also save time if they're recurring members to the website. Having this ability helps them to even better tailor the experience of looking for a record.


### _Consumer_ Audience Device (Milestone 1)
> How will your _consumer_ audience access this website? From a narrow (phone) or wide (laptop) device?
> Justify your decision. (1 sentence)

Audience device: Website

Device Justification:

- Many people when they're doing online shopping typically do it from their computer and the comfort of their home where they're able to envision the things that their buying. Catalogs often contain a lot of information as well, and it's easier to scan/look for things when they're displayed on a larger screen.


### _Consumer_ Persona (Milestone 1)
> Use the goals you identified above to develop a persona of your site's _consumer_ audience.
> Your persona must have a name and a face. The face can be a photo of a face or a drawing, etc.

Why is this a _cohesive_ audience?

This is a cohesive audience because it contains


### _Administrator_ Audience Goals (Milestone 1)
> Document your _administrator_ audience's goals for using this catalog website.
> List each goal below. There is no specific number of goals required for this, but you need enough to do the job (Hint: It's more than 1. But probably not more than 3.)
> **Hint:** Users will be able to view all entries in the catalog and insert new entries into the catalog. The audience's goals should probably relate to these activities.

Goal 1: Update record table data

**_Revised_**
Goal 1: Update/Add records to the website

- **Design Ideas and Choices** _How will you meet those goals in your design?_
  - Design ideas (1-2 sentences)
  - Include a form within the website that updates the table automatically
- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes._
  - Rationale  (1-2 sentences)
  - Forms are user friendly and an easy way to gain information from the user. Forms also allow personalized information to be filtered through backend webprogramming so that it is correctly entered into any table.

Goal 2: Organize data to be easily interpret

- **Design Ideas and Choices** _How will you meet those goals in your design?_
  - Design ideas (1-2 sentences)
  - Include sorting, filtering and searching to be used within within the table

**_Revised_**

- Include filtering the be used within the table


- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes._
  - Rationale (1-2 sentences)
  - Sorting and filtering are common design practices that are used within catalogs and help the user narrow down and organize data so they can use it efficiently.

**_Rationale Revised:_**

- Sorting and searching can be a little complicated but being able to filter the site based off of the tags present for each item provides the best way for organization and easy interpretation. Bolding the tag/using checkboxes to show the user what they're sorting by is another great design patternt to help with organization

Goal 3: Have a personalized interface for my specific type of user

- Design ideas
  - Include a login/logout place so that the website is designed to best fit the administrator using it. the administrator is able to see certain functions and information that consumers shouldn't be able to see.

- Rationale
  - To have a well-designed website it's important to tailor the site to the user to best fit their needs. Consumers and administrators have different goals so having a place to login/logout to change the site layout to best fit their needs is important.


### _Administrator_ Persona (Milestone 1)
> Use the goals you identified above to develop a persona of your site's _administrator_ audience.

## Complete & Polished Website (Final Submission)

### Accessibility Audit (Final Submission)
> Tell us what issues you discovered during your accessibility audit.
> What do you do to improve the accessibility of your site?

Audit fixes

- Fixed the font color in the heading. The black wasn't a good contrast against the dark maroon color so I changed the title in the header to be white.
- In the forms my labels weren't correctly associated with their inputs so I changed the ids to be equivalent for each record so things were grouped correctly.
- My images in the main page that showed all the records also did not have alternative text so I made sure that the alternative text for each image was the name followed by that Album Cover is supposed to be present.


### Self-Reflection (Final Submission)
> Reflect on what you learned during this assignment. How have you improved from Projects 1 and 2?

I learned a lot from this assignment. I think most importantly that big things are easier to handle if you break them down step by step and plan out what you want to do beforehand. Many of my coding classes have taught me this, but this project in particularly that if you can explain what you're trying to do in English/psuedocode and then work step by step in translating that into code that's the best way to do things. Since projects 1 and 2 I've gotten a lot better at implementing more complicated things and combining the things that I've learned. I feel more confident in using multiple databases and I have a better understanding of how each part of querying a database and gainining information on it works.


> Take some time here to reflect on how much you've learned since you started this class. It's often easy to ignore our own progress. Take a moment and think about your accomplishments in this class. Hopefully you'll recognize that you've accomplished a lot and that you should be very proud of those accomplishments! (1-3 sentences)

Seeing the final result of this project is really cool and so great to reflect on. Sometimes while working on the individual parts it doesn't feel very cool or special but seeing images, uploading, login/logout and filtering and forms all work so interactively on the same website is really cool. I feel like I've gained a lot of practical knowledge from doing this course and this project and feel confident in being able to replicate certain features to create different websites that I want to make.
